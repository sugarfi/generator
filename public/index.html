        <h1>Lexicon Generation</h1>
        <p>
        Want to contribute to the lexicon of a new conlang? Simply fill out as many or as few of these forms as you would like! Given a definition, put in the word for that definition in every language you can, seperated by spaces. Each one must be only one word, consisting of only letters from the Latin alphabet (sorry). If a translation is more than one word, simply write it as one: for example, the toki pona phrase 'pona ala' would be submitted as 'ponaala'. If the word has non-Latin letters, you should romanize it and remove any accents: for example, the Esperanto word 'ŝanĝi' would become 'sangi' and the Mandarin word '好' would become 'hao'. You <i>can</i> submit words in the same language twice, but please try to vary the languages used as much as possible. As well, feel free to use Google Translate or another tool to translate words! New definitions will be added reguarly, so be sure to check back often!
